I am a linguist who explores linguistic variation and evolution using phylogenetic comparative methods and Bayesian multilevel modelling. My goal is to explain large-scale typological patterns and change in grammar and lexicon by analyzing qualitative evidence, information from linguistic reference materials, and data from cross-linguistic and cross-cultural databases.
