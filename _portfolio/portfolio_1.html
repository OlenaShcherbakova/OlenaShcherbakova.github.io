The work on my PhD thesis titled The evolution of grammatical complexity: three cross-linguistic studies has been carried out within the framework of a fully funded PhD position at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena (currently, the Max Planck Institute for Geoanthropology) and later at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig. 


<p>Understanding the mechanisms behind the variation in grammatical complexity can allow us to better understand the scope of linguistic diversity and the processes of language change. The studies in my cumulative thesis apply the data and tools that became available with computational turn in linguistic typology to answer the long-standing questions about factors shaping linguistic diversity, in particular in grammatical complexity. My thesis investigates 1) the trade-offs between case and word order, 2) the trade-off between grammatical coding of nominal and verbal marking and 3) how language external factors shape distinct dimensions of grammatical complexity. The results confirm that languages largely vary in their grammatical complexity and do not appear to follow the overarching trade-off restricting all languages to the same complexity level. Instead, the detected trade-offs are found between only some linguistic features, with some trade-offs being lineage-specific. The variation of some dimensions of grammatical complexity are better explained from the perspective of phylogenetic conservatism rather than previous suggested sociodemographic factors.
