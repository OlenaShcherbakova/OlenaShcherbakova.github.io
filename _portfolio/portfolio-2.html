The project is carried out within the framework of the SALTO exchange programme between the CNRS and the MPG during my research stay (mid-September 2023—mid-January 2024) at EA lab (Ecological Anthropology, UMR 7206) at the Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle (MNHN) in Paris, France. The estimated funding corresponds to 10000 euros.

This project aims to test Greenberg’s implicational hierarchy of gender distinctions in kinship terms (siblings = children > grandparents > grandchildren based on which gender distinctions in grandchildren terms can arise after they are already present in other kinship terms on the left) and explore if the presence of sex-based gender systems facilitates distinctions between male and female kinship terms more broadly.
