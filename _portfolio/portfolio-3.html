<p></i>Unraveling the interactions between culture and language: Does grammatical gender foster gender inequality and vice versa?</i> is a project awarded a Constructive Advanced Thinking grant for short stays and research visits for a team of early career researchers (with Neige Rochant, Pei-Ci Li, Dr. Chundra Cathcart, and Dr. Marc Allassonni√®re-Tang). The estimated funding corresponds to 60000 euros. </p>


<p>The human cognitive system interacts with the cultural environment. Within this interaction, the interplay between grammatical gender and sociocultural gender represents a societal challenge. The presence of grammatical gender (such as masculine and feminine) in language has an effect on how men and women are perceived by humans. Most studies compared languages with sex-based gender (such as masculine/feminine in Spanish) with languages that do not have a grammatical gender system (e.g., in English and Mandarin). However, other nominal classification systems such as noun classes (e.g., in Swahili) or classifiers (e.g., in Japanese) also categorize nouns of the lexicon into categories based on features such as animacy or shape. Furthermore, most languages considered in existing studies are Indo-European. Nevertheless, sex-based grammatical gender system are not restricted to this language family. For example, grammatical gender systems are also found in languages such as Mian (Ok family, Papua-New-Guinea). </p>
